## I’m a Biological Sciences student exploring the dev world. I enjoy building practical tools, small apps, and useful software that connect science, data, and technology. I’m currently learning:

JavaScript • HTML • CSS • React • Next.js • Node.js • PostgreSQL

I’m always improving by creating real projects and solving real problems. My goal is to grow as a developer, deliver clean solutions, and bring value to people who need functional, reliable, and well-built web software.
